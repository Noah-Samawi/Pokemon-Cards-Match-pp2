# The Pokémon Cards Match 

Welcome to the Pokémon Cards Match project! This is a simple web-based card-matching game featuring Pokémon cards.

### Rules for the Memory-Matching Game:

#### Objective:

The goal of the game is to match pairs of cards with identical images.

#### Board Setup:

- The game board is a grid with dimensions determined by the rows and columns variables (4x5 in this case).
- Cards are randomly shuffled and placed face down on the board at the start of the game.

### Gameplay:

- Players reveal cards by clicking on them.
- Clicking on a face-down card reveals its image for a brief moment.
- Players must remember the locations and images of the revealed cards.

### Matching:

- If two clicked cards have the same image, they remain face up, and the player scores a match.
- If the images are different, both cards are flipped face down, and the player accumulates an error.

### Errors:

- The number of errors is tracked by the errors variable.
- For each unsuccessful attempt (pair of non-matching cards), the error count increases.
- The error count is displayed on the HTML element with the id "errors."

### Winning:

- The game continues until all pairs of cards are successfully matched.
- Players aim to complete the game with the fewest errors possible.

### Game Flow:

- Cards are initially hidden for 1 second (setTimeout(hideCards, 1000)) after the board is set up.
- Players take turns clicking on pairs of cards to reveal their images.
- The game automatically hides the cards after an unsuccessful attempt to match a pair.

### User Interface:

-The game board is represented by a grid of cards displayed on the HTML page.
- Errors are visually represented, and the count is updated in real-time.

### Technical Details:

- The game logic is implemented using JavaScript.
- Card shuffling is done using the Fisher-Yates (Knuth) algorithm.
- Event listeners handle card clicks and trigger the appropriate game functions (selectCard, update).

### Game Initialization:

- The game starts when the window loads, with cards shuffled and the board set up.

### Game Completion:

- The game is considered complete when all pairs are successfully matched.
- Remember, the success of the game depends on memory and pattern recognition skills. Players aim to minimize errors and complete the game as efficiently as possible.

## Site Owner Goals
- To provide the user with an easy to navigate game that is both fun and educational.
- To present the user with a website that is visually appealing and fully responsive.
- To allow the user to choose from a selection of habitats and also to let them increase the level of difficulty of the game if they wish.
- Invoke a sense of urgency to complete the game as quickly as possible. 
- To entice the user to return to the game to improve their score.

## User Stories

- ### First Time User
  - As a first time user I want to understand the main purpose of the game
  - As a first time user I want to be able to intuitively navigate the game, choose my level of difficulty, choose a habitat, play the game, see my score and restart the game once it ends.
  - As a first time user I want to have fun and learn about animals and their habitats

- ### Returning user
  - As a returning user I want to be able to play the same game without getting the same selection of animals.
  - As a returning user I want to be able to play a different game (different habitat).
  - As a returning user I want to be able to save my score to the leaderboard.

- ### Frequent user
  - As a frequent user I want to be able to increase the level of difficulty of the game.
  - As a frequent user I want to be able to beat my previous score on the leaderboard.


## Design

### Imagery
- The imagery and colour scheme of the site were both given careful consideration to ensure they compliment each other. The imagery used in the game is very important to the overall experience of the user. 
- Cartoon style imagery was chosen to give a playful feel to the site and to appeal to young children. 
- Given that that the game relates to animal habitats, a nature theme is consistently used across all imagery in order to tie in with the overall theme of the game. 

### Colour Scheme

Colour palette from Coolors

![Colour Palette](docs/readme_images/colour_palette.png)

- The colour scheme of the site is mainly green and yellow with varying shades of green used to tie in with the nature imagery. The yellow chosen is happy and cheerful in order to be appealing for young children. 

- The color scheme of the site ties in with the main homepage image and the color picker Chrome extension was used to pull out the main colours as seen in the colour palette. These were then used throughout the site. 

- Great care was taken to establish a good contrast between background colours and text at all times to ensure maximum user accessibility. Depending on the habitat selected, the font colour and and title background colour will change to ensure good contrast against the habitat image.


### Fonts
The Poppins font is the main font used throughout the whole website. This font was imported via [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). The Mochiy Pop P One font is used for the main header and buttons to give a playful feel.  

Sans Serif is used as a backup font, in case for any reason the main font isn't being imported into the site correctly.

### Layout
The site is a single page with 6 sections:
  - Welcome area
  - How to play
  - Leaderboard
  - Game selection area
  - Play game
  - Game over and score

### Wireframes

Wireframes were produced using Balsamiq.

## Features

### Home Page

The landing page of the website has a very simple layout which includes a H1 heading stating the name of the game and three large colourful interactive buttons that are easy for kids to select. The user is given three options to choose from:
 - How to Play
 - Play
 - Leaderboard

 ![Landing Page](docs/readme_images/landing_page.png)

### How to Play Page

If the user clicks the "How to Play" button the instructions section appears and the user can read the main rules of the game. The back button will take them back to the welcome area.

![Instructions](docs/readme_images/instructions_section.png)

### Leaderboard

- The leaderboard section shows the player the three highest scores which have been saved. 
- All scores are saved in local storage so players can only compete with anyone who attempts the quiz on the same machine. 
- The score saved is the number of seconds taken to complete the game. (With the highest score being the least time taken)

![Leaderboard](docs/readme_images/leaderboard_section.png)

### Game Selection

- There are two levels of difficulty to choose from (easy and hard) and this option is presented as a radio button. 
- The default level selected is easy.
- The user can then choose from four habitats - each contains an object of different animals.

### Game Area

#### Easy Game

- The easy game includes four animal cards - three of which are correct answers and one incorrect.
- A different selection of cards is displayed each time a new game is started and the same card will never be duplicated in the same game.
- The background image changes to an image of the habitat selected and the habitat name is inserted into the heading text. 
- The information bar at the top of the game area includes a counter for incorrect attempts and a timer function. 
- If the user selects a correct card it will turn green. If incorrect, the card will display a shake animation.
- When the user clicks on the last correct card the timer stops, the game ends and the game over area appears.

### Input Testing
- The username text input has been tested to ensure it won't save to the leaderboard unless text is inputted into the field.

### Button Testing
- All buttons were tested manually to ensure the user is directed to the correct section of the website and functions run as intended.

### Game Testing
- The game was thoroughly tested by friends and family to ensure that everything worked as intended including the following:
  - Correct and incorrect animal cards were shuffled.
  - The same animal card didn't appear twice in the same game. 
  - The game shows a different selection of cards each time it's played.
  - The scene background changes to match the habitat selected.
  - The name of the habitat selected is inserted into the H2 in the game area once selected.
  - The game ends once all the correct animals have been selected.
  - The timer stops when the game ends.
  - The incorrect attempts counter captures all incorrect clicks.
  - The correct score is shown once the game ends.
  - The leaderboard was tested to ensure that scores are saved in the correct order (quickest time first) and that only three scores are shown.

### Browser Testing
- The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Safari browsers with no issues noted.
    
### Device Testing
- The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone 8, iPhoneX and iPad to ensure responsiveness on various screen sizes in both portrait and landscape mode. The website performed as intended. The responsive design was also checked using Chrome developer tools across multiple devices with structural integrity holding for the various sizes.
- I also used the following website to test responsiveness:
    - [Responsinator](http://www.responsinator.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Faliokeeffe.github.io%2FThe-Animal-Association-Game%2F)

### Fixed Bugs

#### SetTimeout() method on incorrect cards
- When the user selects an incorrect animal during the game a shake animation CSS rule is added to the animal card using a click listener. 
- When testing the game I noticed that once the card has been clicked once, the shake animation didn't fire on subsequent clicks. 
- In order to fix this I added the setTimeout() method to call a function to remove the CSS class after half a second (sufficient time for the animation to finish). This meant that for subsequent incorrect clicks, the shake animation rule could be added to the card again meaning that the card shakes each time it is clicked.

#### Making a Deep Clone of an Object
- In order to avoid having duplicated animals showing in a game, each time an animal card is written to the DOM it is spliced out of the animals object. In order to avoid altering the original animals object I needed to first make a clone of the object and splice the animals out of the new object instead. 
- To do this, I first used the spread operator however I quickly noticed that I was not getting the results I expected and the original object was still being changed when I spliced the cloned object. 
- Upon researching this I realised the issue was that my animals object was actually a nested object. When you have a nested object and you copy it, nested objects inside that object will not be copied. Therefore, if you change the nested object, you will change it for both instances.
- To fix this I had to make a deep clone of the nested object by stringifying the object and parsing it right after - JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(a)). The following article was very useful : [How to differentiate between deep and shallow copies in JavaScript](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/copying-stuff-in-javascript-how-to-differentiate-between-deep-and-shallow-copies-b6d8c1ef09cd/)

#### Username Input Data Validation
- In order to prevent the user saving a blank username to the leaderboard I wrote javaScript to prevent the score saving to the leaderboard if the text input value equaled an empty string. 
- However when I put my project into the peer review slack channel one of my peers kindly tested this validation and was able to save a blank username by inputting an empty space and then saving.
- In order to fix this I did a bit of research and found that the trim function could be used to prevent whitespace from being saved. I was able to amend my function to include this and now the username will only save if a character is inputted.

### Known Bugs
There are no known bugs.

## Credits

### Content
The inspiration for this game came from my children Naomi and Fionn and their favourite book called Wild Animals - Illustrated by  Neiko Ng. The book features many different habitats; jungle, safari, desert, forest etc. The aim of the book is to find all the animals in the picture. I thought that an adapted version of this would be an interesting and fun idea for my javascript project whereby the animals had to be matched to the habitat (instead of being found within it). 

Fionn and Naomi have already got a lot of enjoyment from playing it!
